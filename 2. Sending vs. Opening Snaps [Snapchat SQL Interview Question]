Assume you are given the tables below containing information on Snapchat users, their ages, and their time spent sending and opening snaps. Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps (as a percentage of total time spent on these activities) for each age group.
Output the age bucket and percentage of sending and opening snaps. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places.

Notes:
You should calculate these percentages:
time sending / (time sending + time opening)
time opening / (time sending + time opening)
To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

-- Solution

SELECT ab.age_bucket,
ROUND(100.0*SUM(CASE WHEN a.activity_type='send' THEN a.time_spent ELSE 0 END)/SUM(time_spent),2) AS send_perc ,
ROUND(100.0*SUM(CASE WHEN a.activity_type='open' THEN a.time_spent ELSE 0 END)/SUM(time_spent),2) AS open_perc
FROM activities a  
JOIN age_breakdown ab ON a.user_id=ab.user_id
WHERE activity_type IN ('send','open')
GROUP BY ab.age_bucket
