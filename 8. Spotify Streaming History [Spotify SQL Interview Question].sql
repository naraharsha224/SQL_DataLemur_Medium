You're given two tables containing data on Spotify users' streaming activity: songs_history which has historical streaming data, and songs_weekly which has data from the current week.

Write a query that outputs the user ID, song ID, and cumulative count of song plays up to August 4th, 2022, sorted in descending order.

Assume that there may be new users or songs in the songs_weekly table that are not present in the songs_history table.

Definitions:

song_weeklytable only contains data for the week of August 1st to August 7th, 2022.
songs_history table contains data up to July 31st, 2022. The query should include historical data from this table.

-- Solution

WITH CTE1 AS (
SELECT user_id, song_id, song_plays
FROM songs_history

UNION ALL

SELECT user_id, song_id, COUNT(song_id) AS song_plays
FROM songs_weekly
WHERE listen_time < '08/04/2022 23:59:59'
GROUP BY user_id, song_id)

SELECT user_id, song_id, SUM(song_plays) AS song_plays
FROM CTE1
GROUP BY user_id, song_id
ORDER BY song_plays DESC
